# File-by-file audit log

A slow, deliberate pass over the highest-risk files in the codebase. One file at a
time, read completely — not sampled, not delegated to a subagent, not inferred from
tests passing. Each file is checked for correctness bugs first, then for
organisation and documentation.

Ordered by risk, which is roughly `(damage if wrong) × (untested) × (centrality)` —
not by size. Line counts and test status are from `git ls-files`, measured
2026-08-02.

**Working rule:** a file is only ticked off when it has been read end to end, every
issue found is either fixed or explicitly recorded below as a deliberate
non-change, and the suite still passes.

Why this order: 1 and 6–7 can destroy or leak user data; 2–5 are the generation
path where a bug burns tokens or truncates a reply; 8–10 are the app's spine;
11–12 are contained UI.

## 1. `src/main/conversations/ConversationStore.ts` — done

Every conversation the user has ever had lives here, as JSON files under
`userData/conversations/`. It had no test file at all.

### Bugs fixed

**1.1 A failed write during a project move destroyed the conversation.**
`save()` removed the old file _before_ writing the new one. If the write then
threw (disk full, permissions, antivirus lock), the old file was already gone and
nothing had replaced it. Reordered to write first, then remove the stale file. The
failure mode is now a duplicate file rather than a hole.

**1.2 Deleting a project left `activeConversationId` pointing at a deleted chat.**
`deleteByProjectPermanent()` cleared the cache and the files but never touched the
persisted active-conversation state — unlike its two siblings `deletePermanent()`
and `archiveByProject()`, which both do. Reachable from `ProjectStore.ts:172`:
delete a project while one of its chats is open and the app restarts pointing at a
record that no longer exists.

**1.3 A failed state write left memory and disk permanently disagreeing.**
`setState()` assigned `this.stateCache` before `writeFileSync`. On a write failure
it rethrew, but the in-memory cache kept the new value for the rest of the process
lifetime while disk kept the old one. Cache is now assigned only after the write
succeeds.

**1.4 Corrupted conversation files vanished silently.**
`readFile()` ended in a bare `catch { return null }` — no log, no signal. A chat
that failed to parse simply stopped existing from the user's point of view. It also
did no shape validation: `sanitizeConversationTranscript` calls
`conversation.messages.map(...)`, so a file containing `null`, `[]` or `{}` threw
inside the sanitizer and hit the same silent catch; a file with messages but no
`id` would have been cached under the key `undefined`. Now validates that the
parsed value is an object with a non-empty string `id` and an array of messages,
and logs a warning naming the file on every rejection path.

**1.5 `init()` reset the conversation cache but not the state cache.**
Asymmetric, and wrong if `init()` is ever called twice — the second init would keep
the first's active-conversation id while pointing at a different `userData`
directory. Production calls it once (`main/index.ts:110`); tests do not.

**1.6 `deleteArchived(ids)` did not check that the ids were archived.**
It is reachable from the renderer over IPC and forwards straight to
`deletePermanent`, so a wrong id list permanently destroys live conversations. The
method's name states a precondition that nothing enforced. It now skips
non-archived ids and logs them.

### Cleanups

- `getState()` did not cache the fallback result, so with no state file on disk —
  the first-run case — every call re-hit `existsSync` + `readFileSync`. Now caches
  the default too.
- Three sites computed `Date.now()` twice in one object literal, so `archivedAt`
  and `updatedAt` could differ by a millisecond on the same archive. Single `now`.
- `removeFile()` now passes `{ force: true }` to `rmSync`, so an already-absent
  file is not logged as a failure.

### Deliberate non-changes

- **Mutating the cache while iterating it** (`deleteAll`, `archiveByProject`,
  `restoreByProject` all call `save()` inside `for...of` over the same Map). This
  is safe: `save()` only ever `set`s an id that already exists, and per spec an
  in-place update of an existing key is not revisited by an active iterator. Left
  as is, with a comment.
- **`assertSafeId` does not block Windows device names** (`CON`, `NUL`, `AUX`) or
  cap length. Both are unreachable — ids are generated by the app, never supplied
  by the user — and the regex already blocks the traversal characters that matter.

### Tests added

`src/main/conversations/__tests__/ConversationStore.test.ts` — 11 tests. A partial
mock of `node:fs` lets a write to a chosen path be made to fail on demand, which is
the only way to exercise the failure ordering in 1.1 and 1.3.

Every test was run against the pre-fix file to confirm it actually catches
something. Six failed, one per bug, and were then verified green against the fix.
The remaining five describe behaviour that was already correct and pass either way:
path-safety rejection, the project-move happy path, archive/restore round-tripping,
other projects surviving a project deletion, and `archivedAt === updatedAt` — that
last one is a regression guard only, since the two `Date.now()` calls it replaced
almost always landed in the same millisecond anyway.
