/**
 * finish_goal — how an agent run ends itself cleanly. Only ever registered
 * (see `registry.ts`) for a restricted, non-null `enabledTools` set that
 * explicitly includes it — `AgentRunService` always does this; interactive
 * chat's `enabledTools` is always `null` (unrestricted), so the model never
 * sees this as an option to call unprompted there. Its result flows back the
 * same way every other tool's does — through `ctx.emit`/`onActivity` — so
 * `AgentRunService`'s turn loop just inspects the accumulated tool calls
 * after each generation for a successful `finish_goal`, no special plumbing
 * needed.
